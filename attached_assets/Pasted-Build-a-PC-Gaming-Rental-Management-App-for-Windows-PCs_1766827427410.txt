Build a PC Gaming Rental Management App for Windows PCs connected on the same LAN.
The app must:


Install on all gaming PCs


Have Super Admin, Admin, and Regular User (PC Renter) roles


Track login time, remaining playtime, and auto-logout users


Features:


App auto-starts on Windows boot


Users must log in before accessing games


Admin dashboard shows all PCs and active sessions


Admin can assign playtime and force logout


System automatically logs out renters when time expires


Games close automatically on logout


Prevent renters from closing or bypassing the app


Roles:


Super Admin: full control, manage admins, view all sessions


Admin: assign time, monitor PCs, force logout


Renter: log in and play games only during active session


Works offline over LAN, Windows 10/11 compatible, secure login, real-time sync.

2️⃣ FULL DETAILED PROMPT (Advanced – Best Results)
(You already saw this earlier, this is the enhanced finalized version)
👉 Use the long prompt I previously gave you — it’s already optimized for AI builders and includes:


Roles


Dashboards


Auto logout logic


Security expectations


Optional features


This is ideal if Lovable Dev supports long structured prompts.

3️⃣ RECOMMENDED TECH STACK (Very Important)
✅ BEST OPTION (Most Practical)
Architecture


Client App (Gaming PCs)


Electron.js (Windows desktop)


Runs fullscreen / kiosk mode




Admin Dashboard


Web-based (same LAN)




Backend Server


Node.js + Express




Database


SQLite (small shop) or PostgreSQL (bigger shop)




Why this works:


Easy LAN networking


Real-time updates


One codebase for desktop + web


Fast development



🔁 Alternative (Windows Native)


Client App: C# .NET (WPF or WinForms)


Backend: ASP.NET Core


Database: SQL Server Express


✔ Better Windows integration
❌ Slower to build, more complex

🟢 Recommended for You
Electron + Node.js + SQLite
Simple, cheap, reliable, LAN-friendly.

4️⃣ DATABASE DESIGN (Simple but Powerful)
Tables
users
id
username
password_hash
role (super_admin | admin | renter)
created_at

pcs
id
pc_name
ip_address
status (online/offline)

sessions

5️⃣ SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (SRD)
Project Name
PC Gaming Rental Management System

Objective
To monitor and control gaming time in a PC rental shop by enforcing login-based access and automatic logout.

Functional Requirements


User authentication (Super Admin, Admin, Renter)


Session time tracking


Auto logout when time expires


Admin-controlled time assignment


Game access restriction outside active sessions


Real-time monitoring dashboard


LAN-only operation



Non-Functional Requirements


Windows 10/11 compatibility


LAN-based (no internet required)


Secure authentication


Low system resource usage


Tamper-resistant



Constraints


Must not allow renters to bypass time limits


Must auto-start on system boot


Must close games on logout



Assumptions


All PCs are on the same network


Admin PC acts as server


Games are already installed on PCs



6️⃣ EXTRA FEATURES YOU SHOULD CONSIDER (Real Shop Level)
🔥 Highly recommended:


Time packages (30m / 1h / 2h)


Prepaid balance system


PC lock screen on logout


Sound alert before logout (5 min warning)


Session history export (CSV)



7️⃣ WHAT TO DO NEXT (Roadmap)


Paste FULL PROMPT into Lovable Dev


Choose Electron + Node.js


Start with:


Login screen


Admin dashboard


Session timer




Add:


Auto logout


Game process killer




Test on 2 PCs first (LAN)



If you want, next I can:


Design UI wireframes


Write admin dashboard layout


Create anti-bypass security logic
